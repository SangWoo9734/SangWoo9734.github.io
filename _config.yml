          We have developed a <mark>Docker</mark> based search system that enables patent search or trademark search. Text-based patent search implemented a fast search system using ElasticSearch. The trademark search system measures the similarity with the trademarks learned in advance and displays the results.

          Patent Search:
            - Quickly show search results using ElasticSearch, a distributed open source search and analysis engine.
            - It lists words including the spelling of the search term before searching.
            -  The Google patent page is linked to the same patent as the patent you searched for.

          Trademark Search:
            - Logo Search calculates the similarity between logo images and prints a logo image similar to the target image.
            - Logo Search shows the patent number and name of the logo image and connects to the patent page.
            - Vienna Search provides tabular words that can describe the logo image.
            - Search results provided in tabular format can be saved as csv files.

          In order to understand how the emotional tone contained in Twitter's Korean users' tweets about specific keywords changes over time, we have implemented the function of extracting keyword tweets using the Academic Research API.

            I worked as an undergraduate researcher in the TEAMLAB Data Science Laboratory of Jachon University for about a year. In the laboratory, I was responsible for team projects, personal projects, seminars on new technologies, and Q&A sessions for my professor's lessons.

          After entering the Department of Industrial Management Engineering at Gachon University, I became interested in software while learning about software technology that can be used in industrial engineering. I became interested in learning software, and while majoring in software at Gachon University, I began to dream for developers. I entered the data science laboratory of the Department of Industrial Engineering and studied how to use industrial engineering and software in conjunction with each other, and I am worried about how I can make good use of both majors.
