          This project is a search system designed to enable patent search and trademark search.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          We have developed a <mark>Docker</mark> based search system that enables patent search or trademark search. Text-based patent search implemented a fast search system using ElasticSearch. The trademark search system measures the similarity with the trademarks learned in advance and displays the results.

          Patent Search:
            - Quickly show search results using ElasticSearch, a distributed open source search and analysis engine.
            - It lists words including the spelling of the search term before searching.
            -  The Google patent page is linked to the same patent as the patent you searched for.

          Trademark Search:
            - Logo Search calculates the similarity between logo images and prints a logo image similar to the target image.
            - Logo Search shows the patent number and name of the logo image and connects to the patent page.
            - Vienna Search provides tabular words that can describe the logo image.
            - Search results provided in tabular format can be saved as csv files.

          We used a Typeform service called VideoASK to create a quiz, extract the applicant's voice answers into a file, and textualize voice data through the Clova Voice Recognition API.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
